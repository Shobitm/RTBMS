                            It is also needed for regular transfusions for people with conditions such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease and is used to make products such as clotting factors for people with haemophilia.
There is a constant need for regular blood supply because blood can be stored for only a limited time before use. Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy people are needed to ensure that safe blood will be available whenever and wherever it is needed.
Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components — red cells, platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.

                            Donating blood is an active way of helping others and the whole of society.<br />
                            <strong>For you, it's just a few moments out of your day but for patients in need, it may save their life.</strong><br />
                            Specialist medical staff are on hand at all times during the donation, which is a simple, safe and painless procedure. There is no risk for donors of giving blood, and it may help patients in Catalonia recover more quickly.<br />
                            <strong>Donations - the only way of obtaining blood</strong><br />
                            Despite medical and technological advances, blood cannot currently be made. The only way of getting hold of it is via blood donations from people who give blood.<br />
                            <strong>Each donation may help up to three different people</strong><br />
                            Because each blood donation provides three different blood components, each with its own role in treating patients, it helps up to three different people.
Blood and its components have a limited life<br />
                            •	Red blood cell concentrates can be kept for 42 days<br />
                            •	Plasma can be stored for a year<br />
                            •	Platelets can be kept for five days<br />
                            Blood is used every day: we need 1.000 donations per day in Catalonia<br />
                            Because the need for blood is constant, so is the need for donations. Every day, all the hospitals and clinics in Catalonia need blood and blood components to treat patients, since most surgical interventions and a great number of medical procedures require blood transfusions.
Transfusions of blood and blood components have become an essential part of healthcare today.
                    <br />
                            <strong>Giving blood - part of our routine</strong><br />
                            We don't just need to give blood in the event of tragedies or emergencies. Instead, it should be a normal and routine part of our lives. Regular blood donations mean that there will be sufficient amounts of safe blood in stock.
Remember that men can give blood up to four times a year - women up to three times -providing there are at least two months between donations.

                            By following a few recommendations before, during and after your blood donation can help you make your donation experience as safe, successful and pleasant as possible.<br />
                            <strong>Before Your Donation</strong><br />
                            •	Blood Donation Tip - Eat Healthy<br />
                            •	Maintain a healthy iron level in your diet by eating iron rich foods, such as red meat, fish, poultry, beans, spinach, iron-fortified cereals and raisins.<br />
                            •	Get a good night's sleep.<br />
                            •	Drink an extra 16 oz. of water or nonalcoholic fluids before the donation.<br />
                            •	Eat a healthy meal before your donation. Avoid fatty foods, such as hamburgers, fries or ice cream before donating. (Fatty foods can affect the tests we do on your blood. If there is too much fat in your blood, your donation cannot be tested for infectious diseases and the blood will not be used for transfusion.)<br />
                            •	If you are a platelet donor, remember that your system must be free of aspirin for two days prior to donation.<br />
                            •	Remember to bring your donor card, driver's license or two other forms of ID.<br />
                            <strong>During Your Donation</strong><br />
                            •	Wear clothing with sleeves that can be raised above the elbow.<br />
                            •	Let the person taking your blood know if you have a preferred arm and show them any good veins that have been used successfully in the past to draw blood.<br />
                            •	Relax, listen to music, talk to other donors or read during the donation process.<br />
                            •	Take the time to enjoy a snack and a drink in the refreshments area immediately after donating.<br />
                            •	Have a Successful Blood Donation<br />
                            <strong>After Your Donation</strong><br />
                            •	Drink an extra four (8 ounce) glasses of liquids and avoid alcohol over the next 24 hours.<br />
                            •	Remove the wrap bandage (if you had one put on your arm) within the next hour.<br />
                            •	Keep the strip bandage on for the next several hours.<br />
                            •	To avoid a skin rash, clean the area around the strip bandage with soap and water.<br />
                            •	Do not do any heavy lifting or vigorous exercise for the rest of the day.<br />
                            •	If the needle site starts to bleed, apply pressure to it and raise your arm straight up for about 5-10 minutes or until bleeding stops.<br />
                            •	If you experience dizziness or lightheadedness after donation, stop what you are doing and sit down or lie down until you feel better. Avoid performing any activity where fainting may lead to injury for at least 24 hours.
